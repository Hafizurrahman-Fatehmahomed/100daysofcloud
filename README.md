# 100daysofcloud

Over the next 100 days, I will embark on a journey to complete the "100 Days of Cloud" challenge, inspired by Michael Durkan's comprehensive guide available at https://michaeldurkan.com/100daysofcloud/. My objective is to fully immerse myself in the realm of cloud computing, comprehensively grasping all the covered cloud concepts, and actively gaining hands-on experience with a wide array of service offerings. I'm excited to take on this challenge and expand my expertise in the dynamic field of cloud technology.

Lets go!!
